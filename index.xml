      <description>Welcome to my comprehensive note directory. These typeset works of art are the product of untold hours of study and synthesis of various graduate-level topics in computer science. They were created specifically for Georgia Tech&amp;rsquo;s graduate program, but most of them should be self-contained and well-structured enough to serve as a gentle introduction to many different topics:
  My notes on Computational Perception are the ones that started it all.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m George.
I study computer science and sometimes cook things. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a cypherpunk at heart, particularly interested in cryptography, peer-to-peer technologies, and applications of virtual and augmented reality. I like to write about these topics in various (albeit rare) posts. I also enjoy full sending down Lombard Street on my longboard and finding new Bay Area views on hikes.
Feel free to check out my $\LaTeX$&#39;d notes for some of the graduate courses I&amp;rsquo;ve taken at the Georgia Institute of Technology.</description>
