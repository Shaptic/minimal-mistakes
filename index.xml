      <description>Computational Perception &amp;mdash; this guide provides a (relatively) gentle introduction to computer vision and computational photography. It starts with basic image processing, builds up to &amp;ldquo;old school&amp;rdquo; vision techniques, and eventually closes out with applications of machine learning algorithms to vision. It requires a strong mathematical foundation: a basic understanding of concepts from linear algebra and calculus is assumed, though helpful links to outside resources are provided where it&#39;s relevant.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m George.
I study computer science and sometimes cook things. I&#39;m particularly interested in cryptography, peer-to-peer technologies, and applications of virtual and augmented reality. I like to write about these topics in various (albeit rare) posts. I also enjoy longboarding, rock climbing, and searching for the perfect nacho dish.
You can also check out my $\LaTeX$&#39;d notes for some of the graduate courses I&#39;ve taken at the Georgia Institute of Technology.</description>
