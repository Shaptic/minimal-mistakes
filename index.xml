      <description>Welcome to my comprehensive note directory. These typeset works of art are the product of untold hours of study and synthesis of various graduate-level topics in computer science. They were created specifically for Georgia Tech&amp;rsquo;s graduate program, but most of them should be self-contained and well-structured enough to serve as a gentle introduction to many different topics:
  My notes on Computational Perception are the ones that started it all.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m George.
I study computer science and sometimes cook things. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a cypherpunk at heart, particularly interested in cryptography, peer-to-peer technologies, and applications of virtual and augmented reality. Fittingly, I work at Stellar, creating (hopefully) useful abstractions to the underlying protocol for developers to create apps on our blockchain.
I write about these topics and others in various (albeit rare) posts. I also enjoy full sending down Lombard Street on my longboard and finding new Bay Area views on hikes.</description>

      <description>Woah, how&amp;rsquo;d you get here? This page isn&amp;rsquo;t even linked from anywhere ðŸ˜œ
This site has no tracking, no ads, and no nonsense. I have no idea who reads it, so if you like (or hate!) a post, shoot me an email and tell me!
JavaScript is only used to render math with $\LaTeX$ (I might change this at some point to pre-render images, instead). I believe this is the way the Web should always be.</description>
