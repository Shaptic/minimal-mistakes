I study computer science and sometimes cook nice things. I&rsquo;m particularly interested in cryptography, peer-to-peer technologies, and applications of virtual and augmented reality. I also enjoy longboarding, rock climbing, and searching for the perfect nacho dish.
You can check out my resume, or my \(\LaTeX\)&rsquo;d notes for some of the graduate courses I&rsquo;ve taken at the Georgia Institute of Technology. So far, I have compiled a comprehensive introduction to computer vision as well as a brief overview of the applications of machine learning algorithms to financial trading."/>
