## Shrimp Chowder ##
This chowder is fantastic.  ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ It's _very_ heavy in fat content, though, so keep portions small if you're on a diet. ;) You can try replacing the butter with olive oil for a healthier option, but I have not tried this so I cannot say how it affects the final taste. 

If you want a simple "veggie chowder" (is that a thing?), simply omit the shrimp and use vegetable stock. It still makes an excellent soup. [Source](http://littlespicejar.com/shrimp-and-corn-chowder/).

### Ingredients ###
  - 1 lb,       peeled & deveined shrimp
  - 4 tbsp,     butter
  - 1,          yellow onion, diced
  - 1/2 cup,    celery, diced
  - 4 cloves,   garlic, minced
  - 2 tbsp,     all-purpose flour
  - 1 1/2 tbsp, smoked paprika
  - 1,          bay leaf
  - 4 cups,     stock, preferably seafood
  - 1 lb,       Yukon gold potatoes, diced
  - 2 1/2 cups, frozen corn kernels
  - 2 tsp,      Old Bay seasoning
  - 1 cup,      half & half or heavy cream
  - garnish,    green onions (scallions)

### Preparation ###
  - In a _large pot_ or _dutch oven_, heat **1 tbsp of the butter** over medium-high heat. When it has melted, cook the **shrimp** for 4-7 minutes or until they become completely opaque. Remove and set them aside.
  - Heat the remaining **3 tbsp of butter** and cook the **onions** and **celery** for 3-4 minutes. Add the **garlic** and **flour**, cooking for an additional 2 minutes. When the flour begins to brown, add the **smoked paprika**, **bay leaf**, **stock**, and **potatoes**. 
  - Bring the soup to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to low and simmer (uncovered!) for 15 minutes. Add the **frozen corn** and simmer for another 15 minutes.
  - While the soup is simmering, set aside 8-10 **shrimp** as a finishing garnish. Chop the rest into bite-sized pieces. Add the chopped shrimp, **heavy cream**, and **Old Bay** into the soup. Stir until the cream is incorporated and turn the heat up to low to allow the chowder to heat through.
  - Serve warm, topped with **scallions** and whole shrimp.

**Tip**: I prefer to mince about half of the shrimp into tiny pieces, rather than chopping them into bite-sized ones. This gets more shrimp flavor into every bite!

## Spinach Tagliatelle with Shrimp ##
This is a fantastic dinner dish and looks very fancy when presented properly. For best results, apply the cheese when serving and don't toss the shrimp after adding the cilantro. Just sliiiide it onto a plate of the tagliatelle. 

Adding raw spinach to the pan while preparing the shrimp adds extra nutrition, and you don't have to limit yourself to parmesan cheese! [Source](https://pescetarian.kitchen/spinach-tagliatelle-shrimp-recipe/).

### Ingredients ###
  - 250g,     uncooked shrimp (about 10)
  - 30g,      fresh basil, torn
  - 100ml,    white wine
  - 50ml,     olive oil
  - 50g,      sun-dried tomatoes, minced
  - 1 clove,  garlic, minced
  - 1/2,      lemon, juiced
  - 20g,      parmesan, grated 
  - 300g      fresh spinach tagliatelle
  - pinch,    salt

### Preparation ###
  - Prepare the **spinach tagliatelle** as instructed. 
  - While it's cooking, heat the **olive oil** in a _large pan_ over medium-high heat.
  - Combine the **shrimp**, **garlic**, **sun-dried tomatoes**, **salt**,
    **lemon juice**, and **white wine** in the pan.
  - Cook the shrimp until they're completely pink and the wine has reduced down.
  - Take the pan off the heat and garnish the fresh **basil** on top.
  - Plate up the **tagliatelle** and pour over the shrimp. 
  - Sprinkle over the **parmesan**.

## Guacamole Quesadillas ##
This makes for an excellent snack (if you can control yourself) or lunch dish (if you can't). It's not the best for refrigeration, as the tortillas will get a bit soggy from the guacamole, but still tastes fantastic warmed up. [Source](https://pescetarian.kitchen/guacamole-quesadillas-recipe/).

### Guacamole Ingredients ##
  - 2,        avocados, cubed
  - 1/4,      red onion, finely chopped
  - 1,        green chili pepper, finely chopped
  - 1/2 tsp   salt, pepper
  - handful,  fresh cilantro, chopped
  - 1 tsp,    cumin
  - 1/2,      lime, juiced
  - 1,        tomato, diced

### Quesadilla Ingredients ##
  - 1 tbsp,       olive oil
  - 4,            large tortillas
  - 1 tbsp,       **guacamole**
  - 4 oz,         cheddar cheese, thinly sliced
  - handful,      fresh cilantro, finely chopped

### Preparation ###
  - For the **guacamole**, mash the **avocados** in a _large bowl_ and then mix in the rest of the ingredients.
  - Heat a _large pan_ on a medium heat.
  - Get the **tortillas** and brush one side lightly with **olive oil**.
  - Put one tortilla oiled side down in the pan and place half of the **cheese** evenly on the tortilla. 
  - When the cheese has almost melted, spread **guacamole** on top of the cheese, almost to the edge of the tortillas, and sprinkle the **cilantro** on top.
  - Cover with the second tortillas, oiled side up.
  - Cook for another minute, until the bottom is slightly toasted, then flip it, so that the second tortilla is now toasting on the bottom. 
  - After 2 minutes, the second tortilla should also be toasted. Remove the quesadilla from the pan and serve.

**Note**: This means that a single quesadilla uses two tortillas, one on top and one on bottom. The tortilla will shrink as you toast it. This means the top tortilla will be larger if placed directly.

**Tip**: I recommend preparing the two sides individually -- one with cheese and the other with the guacamole -- and then combining them. This can be much easier than flipping a full quesadilla.

## Avocado Baked Eggs ##
This makes for an incredibly rich and simple breakfast dish, but the prep work can be a little tedious without experience. [Source](https://pescetarian.kitchen/avocado-baked-eggs/).

### Ingredients ###
  - 1,        large avocado
  - 1/4,      lemon, juiced
  - 2,        eggs _(smaller is better)_
  - pinch,    salt, black pepper
  - handful,  fresh cilantro, chopped

### Preparation ###
  - Preheat your _oven_ to 425Â°F.
  - Halve the **avocados** and remove the seeds.
  - Scoop out a larger hole within each avocado half with a teaspoon.
  - Squeeze out the **lemon juice** over the tops of the avocado halves. This will stop them turning brown in the oven.
  - Crack your **eggs** into each half and add a pinch of salt and pepper on top.
  - Place them on a _small baking tray_ against each other (for balance) and put them in the oven for 15-18 minutes.
  - Let stand 1 minute before serving, unless you have a mouth of steel.

**Note**: the eggs will not be cooked solid (and will wobble), but this is intentional and they are fully cooked.

## Vegetable Fried Rice ##
This recipe is a fantastic way to replicate restaurant-style fried rice and know exactly what is in it! [Source](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/21186/vegetable-fried-rice/).

### Ingredients ###
  - 1.5 cups, uncooked brown rice (about 3 cups cooked)
  - 2 tbsp,   peanut oil
  - 1 small,  yellow onion, chopped
  - 1 small,  green bell pepper, chopped
  - 1 tsp,    garlic, minced (about 2 cloves)
  - 1/4 tsp,  red pepper flakes (to taste)
  - 3,        green onions, thinly sliced
  - 3 tbsp,   soy sauce
  - 1 cup,    frozen petite peas
  - 2 tsp,    sesame oil
  - 1 tbsp,   sesame seeds (optional)

### Preparation ###
  - Prepare the **rice** as instructed on the package. Let it cool overnight.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" style="font-size: smaller">[1]</a></sup>
{: #footnote-1-root}

  - Heat **peanut oil** in a _large skillet_ or _wok_ over medium heat. 
  - Add **onions**, **bell pepper**, **garlic** and **pepper flakes**, to taste. 
  - SautÃ© until the onions are clear, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. 
  - Increase heat to medium-high and stir in cold cooked rice, **green onions** and **soy sauce**. Stir-fry for 1 minute. 
  - Add the **peas** and cook for several more minutes, then remove from heat. They will soften much faster than through their traditional cooking method.
  - Add **sesame oil** and mix well.
  - Garnish with **sesame seeds** if desired.

**Tip**: if there's a lot of liquid after sautÃ©ing the vegetables, drain about half of it so that the final product isn't too soggy.
